# Tree Visualizer

This is a simple web application that visualizes binary trees, max-heaps, and binary search trees based on user input. The visualization offers an intuitive way to understand the structure of these data structures.

## Features

1. **Binary Tree Visualization**: Displays a binary tree based on the provided array.
2. **Max-Heap Visualization**: Displays a max-heap representation of the input array.
3. **Binary Search Tree Visualization**: Displays a binary search tree based on the sorted input array.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Ensure you have a web browser that supports modern JavaScript.

### Setup

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

## Usage

1. Input a series of numbers separated by spaces or commas in the input field labeled "Array."
2. Click on the desired visualization button to see the representation:
    - **Binary Tree Visualization**: Represents the array as a binary tree.
    - **Max-Heap Visualization**: Represents the array as a max-heap.
    - **Binary Search Tree Visualization**: Represents the array as a binary search tree.

## Code Structure

- `style.css`: Contains the styling for the application.
- `nodes.js`: Contains the logic for creating and managing tree nodes.
- `heap.js`: Contains logic related to the max-heap data structure.
- `app.js`: Main application logic and D3 visualization functions.
